## About

The examples show how to tackle linear algebra in C++, which based on Linux and Visual Studio 2015.

## A

It shows how to create a matrix by using Eigen. 

## B

It shows how to create a dynamic matrix by using Eigen.

## C

It shows how to create a static matrix by using Eigen.

## D

It shows how to access the elements of a matrix.

## E

It shows the function of overloaded operator "<<" in Eigen.

## F

It shows the function of operator "=" in Eigen, when the size of  left and right sides¡® matrix are unequal.

## G

It shows two kinds of methods for block operation of matrix in Eigen.

## H

It shows how to obtain a specified row or column of matrix in Eigen.

## I

It shows block operation of vector in Eigen.

## J

It shows the addition and subtraction operation of matrix in Eigen.

## K

It shows the multiplication and division operation of matrix in Eigen.

## L

It shows the function of some member functions of Eigen.

## M

It shows the multiplication operation between matrix and vector.

## N

It is shown the QR decomposition of matrix by using Eigen.

## Note

Based on Visual Studio 2015, the entire project can be a key loaded by linearAlgebraCpp.sln.
