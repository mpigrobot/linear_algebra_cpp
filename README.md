## About

The examples show how to tackle linear algebra in C++ with Linux and Visual Studio 2015.

## Demo A

It shows how to create a matrix by using Eigen. 

## Demo B

It shows how to create a dynamic matrix by using Eigen.

## Demo C

It shows how to create a static matrix by using Eigen.

## Demo D

It shows how to access the elements of a matrix.

## Demo E

It shows the function of overloaded operator "<<" in Eigen.

## Demo F

It shows the function of operator "=" in Eigen, when the size of  left and right sides¡® matrix are unequal.

## Demo G

It shows two kinds of methods for block operation of matrix in Eigen.

## Demo H

It shows how to obtain a specified row or column of matrix in Eigen.

## Demo I

It shows block operation of vector in Eigen.

## Demo J

It shows the addition and subtraction operation of matrix in Eigen.

## Demo K

It shows the multiplication and division operation of matrix in Eigen.

## Demo L

It shows the function of some member functions of Eigen.
